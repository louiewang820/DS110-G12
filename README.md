# Problem Statement 
* Students will work together in groups to complete a Data Science project from the beginning (downloading data from the web) to the end (communicating their methods and conclusions in an electronic report). The electronic report will be a Jupyter notebook in which the code cells will download a dataset (chosen from the list of options below) from the web, reproducibly and sensibly wrangle and clean, summarize and visualize the data, as well as appropriately answer a predictive question. Markdown cells will be used throughout the document to narrate the analysis to communicates the question asked, methods used and the conclusion reached.
